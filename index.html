        <h2>If you're reading this, you probably got lost somehow.</h2>
        <p>Feeling lost? Well, you could always press that X-button on the tab or even the left-pointing arrow near the address bar (or perhaps at the bottom if you're a mobile sicko).</p>
        <p>But why not stay for a few goodies?</p>
        <p>Here are some links:
            <ul>
                <li>you wish</li>
                <li>AND SO MUCH MORE!!! <span title="PLEASE HELP IM TRAPPED IN DOKTOREGOS BASEMENT AND I CANT FEEL MY SPLEEN" class="jeeves">(well not really but you get the point)</span></li>
            </ul>
